- 👋 Hi, I’m @atoastybagel an amateur, intermediate level self-teaching C++ hobbyist.
- 👀 I’m interested in using SDL2 to create little games as a hobby. How would one go about programming a Rasberry Pi + breadboard in a low-level lang?
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ 
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn everything I can about Computer Science as a general concept with a current focus on Vulkan + SDL2. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
